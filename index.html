    <h1>Crystals Collector!</h1>
    <p>You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
        <br>
        There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
        <br>
        You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
        <br>
        The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
        <br>
        Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
    </p>
