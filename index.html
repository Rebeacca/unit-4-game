        <p>You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your
            total score.
            <br>
            <br>
            You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score
            goes above the random number.
            <br>
            <br>
            The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
